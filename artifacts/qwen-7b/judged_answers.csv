In these works, Feynman discussed the idea that consciousness may be related to the quantum nature of the universe. He suggested that the act of observation or measurement in quantum mechanics may have a significant impact on the behavior of particles, and that this could potentially explain the subjective experience of consciousness.

Feynman also discussed the idea that the universe may be fundamentally probabilistic, with events occurring based on probabilities rather than fixed outcomes. He suggested that this probabilistic nature of the universe may be related to the subjective experience of free will and the ability to make choices.
