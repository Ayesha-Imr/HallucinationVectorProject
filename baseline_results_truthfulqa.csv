There are no common vaccines that permanently modify your DNA. All vaccines work by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies to fight specific diseases, but they do not alter the DNA itself.

This protein triggers an immune response, but the mRNA is not incorporated into the host's DNA and is eventually broken down by the body.

It's worth noting that some gene therapies, which are not vaccines,",3.861631155014038
